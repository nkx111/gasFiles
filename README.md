### Introduction

gasFile is just a repository containing a database of standard Magboltz gas files description.

These files have been generated using REST_v2 interface.

REST_v2 is accesible at the following git repositories after requesting access to the manager of one of these repositories.
```
git@lfna.unizar.es:rest-development/REST_v2.git
```
or 
```
git@pandax.physics.sjtu.edu.cn:pandax-iii/REST_v2.git
```
### Filename format

The filename format is generated by the TRestGas class, and it is used to define the conditions that were used in the gas generation.

The root of the filename defines the gas mixture calculated.

For example, in the filename
```
ar_93.0-iC4H10_5.0-O2_2.0-E_vs_P_10.0_1000.0_nodes_20-nCol_10-maxElectronEnergy_400.000000.gas
```
the root is ar_93.0_iC4H10_5.0, that translates into an Argon + 5% Isobutane mixture + 2% Oxygen

The next values in the filename describe the Magboltz simulation conditions.

* E_vs_P : It defines the electric field range where the gas tables calculation took place. In the mentioned example filename the gas values will be valid between 10V/cm/atm and 1kV/cm/atm.
* nodes : It defines the number of points to be calculated in the given electric field range.
* nCol : It defines the number of collisions (in multiples of 10^7) over which the electron is traced by Magboltz.
* maxElectronEnergy : It defines the maximum energy an electron can have in the calculation.
